# Requirements and Goals of the App
The primary objective of the weight loss tracking app I developed was to provide users with a comprehensive tool to monitor their weight loss journey and progress towards their goal. This app was designed to address the needs of individuals who are committed to losing weight and require a reliable and user-friendly platform to track their progress. The app allows users to create an account, set a target weight and date, log their current weight, and view their progress over time. By offering these features, the app aims to motivate users to stay on track with their weight loss goals, providing them with a sense of achievement and accountability.

# Screens and Features to Support User Needs
To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, several screens and features were essential. The primary screens included a login and registration screen, a main dashboard displaying the user's current weight, target weight, and progress, and a goal-setting screen where users can set their weight loss goals. Additionally, features such as password visibility toggles, input validation, and data storage using SQLite were integrated to enhance user experience. The UI designs were centered around ease of use, accessibility, and intuitiveness, ensuring that users can navigate the app effortlessly. By keeping the design clean and straightforward, with minimal distractions, the app successfully meets the users' needs for a simple yet effective weight loss tracking tool.

# Approach to Coding the App
I will admit, I originally approached this assignment with a focus on the overall finished product rather than breaking down the code into manageable, scalable parts. Due to unforeseen circumstances, this approach proved challenging, and I did not allocate sufficient time for thorough planning and incremental development. This experience has highlighted the importance of starting work with adequate time to address potential challenges. Moving forward, I will ensure to break down the project into smaller, more manageable components from the outset. Additionally, incorporating planned buffer time into my schedule will help mitigate stress and provide flexibility to overcome obstacles in the codebase, ultimately leading to more successful and efficient project completion.

# Testing for Functionality
To ensure the functionality of my code, I implemented a comprehensive testing process. This involved both manual and automated testing techniques. I conducted unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components and integration tests to ensure that different parts of the app worked seamlessly together. Additionally, I performed user acceptance testing by simulating real-world usage scenarios. This process is crucial as it helps identify and rectify bugs, ensures that the app performs as expected, and provides a smooth user experience. The testing process revealed areas where the app could be optimized and helped fine-tune the user interface for better usability.

# Overcoming Challenges
I am still overcoming challenges with this codebase. Although the course has ended, the challenge of getting this code to work properly remains a priority for me. Ensuring the app's functionality and reliability is crucial, and I am committed to resolving any issues that arise. This ongoing challenge keeps me engaged and motivated to refine my coding skills and enhance the app's performance until it meets the highest standards of quality and user satisfaction.

# Demonstrating Knowledge and Skills
One specific component of the mobile app where I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience was the user authentication system. By integrating secure password hashing, managing user sessions, and implementing comprehensive validation checks, I showcased my ability to develop robust and secure features. This component required a deep understanding of security principles, database management, and user experience design, allowing me to apply my technical skills effectively to solve complex problems and deliver a reliable solution for users.
